      <description>Working Remotely in Medellin Medellin is a wonderful place to live and work remotely, especially for folks on the East Coast timezone.
Medellin is easily accessible and full of friendly locals. The city has a violent history, but is now relatively safe, as long as you follow the street smart rules of Latin America.
The city is still wonderful and offers great value, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the same undiscovered paradise it was back from 2008-2015.</description>
