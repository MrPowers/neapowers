# Larry Summers

## Larry Summers Says the Fed Should Taper Faster (September 24, 2021)

The task of growing the Chinese economy has been very real estate dependent.

He was happy the Fed said they would taper later this year.

He wishes the Fed would taper faster.  He thinks it's going to look a bit more stagflationary now.  Continuing inflation pressure and less growth, given bottlenecks and labor shortages.

In the Michigan survey, people are saying they don't think it's a good time to buy a car or a house.  That's a negative demand side indicator.

Crypto suggests the desire for secrecy for large financial sums.

We wouldn't have a viable airline industry if we didn't regulate airline safety.  Ultimately, blockchain based business will do better being regulated in a sound way.

The idea where Bitcoin will be some sort of libertarian paradise, then it'll be resting on a flimsy foundation.

## House Prices are Scary (July 3, 2021)

Labor force participation did not increase in the latest job return.  The long awaited return of workers still hasn't materialized.

The CBO report says the deficit will be $3 trillion in 2021 and then go down to $1.2 trillion in the out years of the 10 year forecast.

The CBO report makes the following assumptions:

* no passage of the Biden plan
* no passage of a range of tax cuts
* no "emergencies"

Probably a substantial underestimation of where the deficit will actually turn out.

It's saying that we'll be a country for a decade where the real interest rate is negative, the budget deficit will be 5% of GDP, and where the debt ratio will be above 100%.  The implication is that this is sustainable.  Summers thinks this might be sustainable, but maybe not.

He thinks the conventional wisdom is behind the curve on inflation.

The most dangerous times in markets are when people think they're too high.

Summers "throw in the towel" theory:

* Markets go up, some investors short, it keeps going up, those investors throw in the towel
* Markets keep going up, more investors short, they also lose money, they throw in the towel
* Eventually a lot of pessimism gets beaten out of the market and this is when they're most vulnerable

Biggest bubble of all time was Japan in the 1980s:

* Some people threw in the towel at 25,000
* Others threw in the towel at 30,000
* Eventual collapse came at 39,000

He's worried that people have learned exactly the wrong lessons from the US equity markets over the last 12 years, from the phenomenal 6 fold increase in the S&P 500 index since 2009.

* Most investors have learned the lesson that trees grow to the sky
* Summers learned the lesson that trees have grown too tall to be stable

Many failures for pessimism can ironically be a basis for even bigger pessimism.

He thinks the housing market is scary.  For most people, rising house prices means inflation.

He guesses there will be continued increases in house prices given shortages.

House price increases are a significant indicator of inflation psychology.

He cannot understand why the Federal Reserve is a major buyer of mortgage backed securities every month.  This is the ultimate in procyclical behavior.

## Worried about inflation (March 19, 2021)

US Treasury yield from 0.4% to 1.8% in March 2021.

People have declared that it's a new era in ways that suggest that large fiscal policy will continue for a long time to come.

COVID recovery has accelerated, which is a great thing, but means more demand pressure.

The Fed has stuck to its guns on no rate hikes for years and years (and continuing to grow its balance sheet).

He's worried about more inflation or a dramatic fiscal/monetary collision.

These are the least responsible macroeconomic policies we've had in the last 40 years.

He thinks there is a 1/3 chance that inflation will significantly increase over the next few years and we'll be in a stagflation situation.  Like the situation that happened between 1966-1969 where inflation went from ~1% to ~6%.

There is a 1/3 chance that we won't see inflation, but this will be because the Fed hits the brakes hard and the markets get unstable.

There a 1/3 chance the Fed will get what they're hoping for which is rapid growth in a non-inflationary way.

Macro policy in the past was working to stabilize world events.  Now macro policy itself may be destabilizing for the economy.

Krugman isn't worried about inflation because he thinks it takes a long time to develop and the Fed will have ample time to react.  Summers thinks he's just wrong.

He's been rather disappointed by the economics profession.  He thinks economists should analyze the economics, not rationalize what's politically convenient.  He's been disappointed with people like Paul Krugman for gravitating to the political side of the conversation.
