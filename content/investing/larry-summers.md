US Treasury yield from 0.4% to 1.8% in March 2021.

People have declared that it's a new era in ways that suggest that large fiscal policy will continue for a long time to come.

COVID recovery has accelerated, which is a great thing, but means more demand pressure.

The Fed has stuck to its guns on no rate hikes for years and years (and continuing to grow its balance sheet).

He's worried about more inflation or a dramatic fiscal/monetray collision.

These are the least responsible macroeconomic policies we've had in the last 40 years.

He thinks there is a 1/3 chance that inflation will significantly increase over the next few years and we'll be in a stagflation situation.  Like the situation that happened between 1966-1969 where inflation went from ~1% to ~6%.

There is a 1/3 chance that we won't see inflation, but this will be because the Fed hits the brakes hard and the markets get unstable.

There a 1/3 chance the Fed will get what they're hoping for which is rapid growth in a non-inflationary way.

Macro policy in the past was working to stabilize world events.  Now macro policy itself may be destabilizing for the economy.

Krugman isn't worried about inflation because he thinks it takes a long time to develop and the Fed will have ample time to react.  Summers thinks he's just wrong.

He's been rather disappointed by the economics profession.  He thinks economists should analyze the economics, not rationalize what's politically convenient.  He's been disappointed with people like Paul Krugman for gravitating to the political side of the conversation.
