## Episode #311: Radio Show

You should build an investing portfolio with a plan with the knowledge that at some point, you'll encounter something you've never seen before.

2020 was the fastest time from an all time high, to a bear market, and back to all time highs.

Stock risk is correlated with what's going on in the real world, with your human capital.

His current pinned tweet [shows graphs](https://twitter.com/MebFaber/status/1357385747825790976) that demonstrates all the craziness that's going on right now.  It's hard to get through this pinned tweet without feeling nervous, especially what's happening in the United States.

Bonds are easy to forecast nominally.  The yield is almost always what you get nominally.

US stock market valuations are really high.  Expectations are unrealistic.  Investor allocation to stocks is higher than ever in history.  Interest rates are going up.  Taxes are going up.  Only thing left is for the trend to turn.  We're up to ~37 on the CAPE ratio.

Market cap weighted indexes don't include fundamentals or valuation.

When CAPE has been so high historically:

* 1998-2000 in US
* 88-89 & 99 EAFE (Japan was super high in the late 80s)
* 2007 Emerging markets (China & India were super high)

Japan had zero returns for 30 years.  Looks amazing now.

You have to consider that the large cap US stocks will return zero.

Value got to historic spreads.  2020 was the worst year for value.  1999 before was the best year for growth / worst year for value.

US investors put 80% in the US and that seems crazy to Meb.

AQR pointed out that the recent crazy outperformance of the US is almost entirely attributable to multiple expansion.

Russia has CAPE of 8.  US is 38.  They've had same stock market performance over the last 5 years.

Meb thinks the story has finally changed in the last year.  He thinks there's been a regime change and value is now set to outperform.

In the summer we were coming off 10-year yields of 0.5%.

US bonds are some of the higher-yielding in the world, which is crazy.  Lots of countries have negative yields.

Meb has been blogging for 15 years.
