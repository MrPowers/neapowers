## Inflation, bubbles, and the future of value investing (June 24, 2021)

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPwBeok5DTM&ab_channel=ExcessReturns)

Money managers need to get lucky when they first start out cause they need a good first couple of years.

Arnott is a libertarian.  He prefers limited government to big government.

Fiscal stimulus makes its way into the financial markets. Send people money and what they don't spend will end up going into the capital markets.

Fiscal stimulus causes asset bubbles.  Fed governors routinely dismiss this argument.

Fiscal stimulus causes asset bubbles thereby increasing income inequality because the rich are the ones with the assets.

Fiscal stimulus doesn't stimulate the economy.  It doesn't boost the production of goods and services.

Fiscal stimulus doesn't stimulate the macro economy.

He doesn't see this Fed or this government as being eager to shut off the spigot unless they are forced to.

Arnott could imaging fairly severe inflation being greeted with a Fed that keeps rates at zero.

The methodology that the Asset Interactive tool uses has been backtested and they've found it to be pretty accurate on a +/- 2% with historical data.

Here are some expected returns for the next 10 years:

* US equities: 2%
* Emerging markets: 8%
* RAFI emerging markets: 13%

RAFI is 99% sure of beating US equities.

He has well over half his liquid net worth in emerging markets fundamental index.

He has a relatively undiversified portfolio at the moment.

Emerging markets have their own version of FANG stocks - they're called the BAT stocks.  Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent.

RAFI is more effective at capturing value in emerging markets than a cap weighted value strategy.

Definition of a bubble:

* What assumptions do you need to make about future growth to justify the current price? If the assumptions are extravagant and implausible, then you might have a bubble
* does the marginal buyer care about valuations

Current examples:

* Apple's valuation is justifiable with aggressive assumptions.  There are Apple buyers that believe in the aggressive assumptions and that's why they're buying.  Apple doesn't meet the bubble definition.

* Tesla's price can only be justified by implausible assumptions.  Tesla's investors aren't using valuation models.  So Tesla meets the definition of a bubble.

Bubbles can last longer and go farther than anyone could possibly imagine.

Anti-bubbles are opposite examples where you need to use implausibly bleak assumptions to not make money.  Great examples are Russian and Chinese state-owned enterprises.

Cap weighting overweights the overpriced stock and underweights the cheap stocks.

Active managers get the market returns in aggregate - some win and other lose.

Arnott said every active manager should be asked this question: "If you're so smart, then who is the loser on the other side of your trades and why are they willing be be stupid".  You don't know your alpha engine if you don't know the answer to this.

RAFI contra trades against the market's biggest bets.  The people on the other side of the trade are momentum following trend followers who like to load up on the most expensive, beloved companies.  Arnott is confident that they'll lose in the long run.

They wrote a paper called Reports of Value's Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated.

Value has underperformed by getting cheaper.  Cheaper as in valuation relative to growth.

In 2007, value was as richly priced as we've seen in 30 years.

Other than the summer of 2020 and the tech bubble, value is the cheapest it's ever been.

It's fine to make a bet when valuations are stretched to extreme levels.  The question is how big of a bet do you make given the signal.

Value is at the 98th percentile of relative valuation right now.

The linkage between interest rates / real interest rates and the growth / value cycle is very weak.

The mistake 99% of investors make with some regularity is buy high and sell low.  When an asset has returned a lot, you should think about selling.  You should always have an exit strategy when investing in growth assets.

For value strategies, always have an entrance rule.  Arnott buys value when it's cheap relative to fundamentals and the asset is no longer in freefall.

The stimulus and the retail community have been massive for the stock market.  Part of this was stimulus that wasn't needed.  People got stimulus checks and popped them in the market.

Stimulus is highly correlated with future corporate profits.  The notion that stimulus helps main street and not wall street is utterly naive.

Printing money and using it to spend on chosen projects is a form a central control that isn't effective.

Shiller P/E ratio is at 34 & was only lower during the dot-com bubble.  Price / Sales and market cap / GDP are higher than ever in history.  These are daunting multiples.

Europe is priced at half our multiples.

When things break, they break fast.  We know this from the COVID crash, tech bubble, and global financial crisis.  The majority of losses can happen in 6 weeks.

According to Fama/French, value peaked in 2007.  According to P/E, value peaked in 2013.  They all hit bottom in August 2020.  They've since snapped back.

Value had a drubbing.  The biggest and longest value drawdown in history.

Value was even cheaper relative to growth in 2020 compared to the peak of the tech bubble.

Definition of bubble:

1. You need to make implausible assumptions in the valuation model
2. None of the marginal buyers use valuation models

"Bubble assessment" for some current valuations:

* Amazon is priced for aggressive assumptions
* Tesla is priced for growth that wouldn't be remotely plausible and nobody buys Tesla on a valuation model

They predict ~2% returns in the US for the next 10 years.  Yield is 1.6%.

Lots of international and emerging market assets are priced to give much better returns.

Half of Arnott's assets are in emerging market deep value stocks.

Meb's whole 401k goes into emerging markets.

Arnott has noticed that the reaction is often anger when he challenges conventional wisdom.

EAFE is at a CAPE of 18.  Emerging are at a CAPE of 15.

Emerging markets have their version of FAANG stocks.  They're called the BAT stocks.  Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent.

BAT stocks are priced similar to the FAANG stocks.

15 years ago, there was nothing people wanted more than BRICs.  2000-2007, BRICs massively outperformed the S&P.

End of 2007:

* EM CAPE: 38
* US CAPE: 28

EM CAPE was a 40% premium, now it's a 60% discount.  Same companies & same countries still facing the same headwinds.

A lot of emerging countries are catching up economically by imitating and stealing ideas.

UK is almost the chepest developed market (Spain is slightly cheaper).

People send most of their investment research time thinking about buying.  They don't have any selling plan.

Rob Arnott has made a career of being curious.  Whenever there is conventional wisdom, he'll run a test to see if it's demonstrably correct with historical data.

Arnott holds his beliefs lightly.

Since the top of the tech bubble, long bonds have outperformed stocks.  There have been 40 year periods where bonds have outperformed.

In 2000, long bond yields weren't bad and valuations were in the stratosphere.  Now, long bond yields are terrible and valuations are in the stratosphere.

Rob has been called a permabear, but in his whole investing career, he's actually never had a meaningful cash reserve.

The average emerging market allocation for US advisors is 3%.
