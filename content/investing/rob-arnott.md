The stimulus and the retail community have been massive for the stock market.  Part of this was stimulus that wasn't needed.  People got stimulus checks and popped them in the market.

Stimulus is highly correlated with future corporate profits.  The notion that stimulus helps main street and not wall street is utterly naive.

Printing money and using it to spend on chosen projects is a form a central control that isn't effective.

Shiller P/E ratio is at 34 & was only lower during the dot-com bubble.  Price / Sales and market cap / GDP are higher than ever in history.  These are daunting multiples.

Europe is priced at half our multiples.

When things break, they break fast.  We know this from the COVID crash, tech bubble, and global financial crisis.  The majority of losses can happen in 6 weeks.

According to Fama/French, value peaked in 2007.  According to P/E, value peaked in 2013.  They all hit bottom in August 2020.  They've since snapped back.

Value had a drubbing.  The biggest and longest value drawdown in history.

Value was even cheaper relative to growth in 2020 compared to the peak of the tech bubble.

Definition of bubble: if you're using a valuation model you need to make implausible assumptions and the none of the marginal buyers use valuation models.

Assumptions for some current valuations:

* Amazon is priced for aggressive assumptions
* Tesla is priced for growth that would be remotely plausible and nobody buys Tesla on a valuation model

They predict ~2% returns in the US for the next 10 years.  Yield is 1.6%.

Lots of international and emerging market assets are priced to give much better returns.

Half of Arnott's assets are in emerging market deep value stocks.

Meb's whole 401k goes into emerging markets.

Arnott has noticed that the reaction is often anger when he challenges conventional wisdom.

EAFE is at a CAPE of 18.  Emerging are at a CAPE of 15.

Emerging markets have their version of FAANG stocks.  They're called the BAT stocks.  Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent.

BAT stocks are priced similar to the FAANG stocks.

15 years ago, there was nothing people wanted more than BRICs.  2000-2007, BRICs massively outperformed the S&P.

End of 2007:

* EM CAPE: 38
* US CAPE: 28

EM CAPE was a 40% premium, now it's a 60% discount.  Same companies & same countries still facing the same headwinds.

A lot of emerging countries are catching up by imitating and stealing ideas.

UK is almost the chepest developed market.

People send most of all their research thinking about buying.  They don't have any selling plan.

Rob Arnott has made a career of being curious.  Whenever there is conventional wisdom, he'll run a test to see if it's demonstrably correct with history.

Arnott believes in holding beliefs lightly.

Since the top of the tech bubble, long bonds have outperformed stocks.  There have been 40 year periods where bonds have outperformed.

In 2000, long bond yields weren't bad and valuations were in the stratosphere.  Now, long bond yields are terrible and valuations are in the stratosphere.

Rob has been called a permabear, but in his whole investing career, he's actually never had a meaningful cash reserve.

The average emering market allocation for US advisors is 3%.
