# Stanley Druckenmiller


## Current Fed policy is totally inappropriate (May 11, 2021)

The current fiscal / monetary policy is the most radical policy, by a long shot, that he's seen relative to the economic circumstances.

We're back to normal GDP and above trend on retail sales.

He understood the policy actions at the onset of the Corona crisis, but when the facts change, you have to change.

In normal circumstances, given the current economic numbers, the Fed would be looking at an interest rate hike right now.

In 6 weeks (last Spring), we did more QE than the entire 9 year period from 2009-2018.

Retail sales are now above trend.  He has a problem with the Fed continuing to do QE now that the crisis is over.

He supported the first stimulus check.  He didn't support the second and third stimulus checks.

He thinks we've crossed the rubicon and the dollar will no longer be the reserve country of the world.  It's more likely than not that within 15 years the dollar loses reserve currency status.

Without the Fed buying ~60% of the bond market issuances, the market would be totally rejecting this.

We're right now in the crux of when the baby boomer retirement will accelerate.

For 20 years, foreigners were buying Treasuries.  This trend was reversed in Spring 2020.  We went from a $500 billion a year into Treasuries to an outflow from Treasuries.
