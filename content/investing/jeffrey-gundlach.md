# Jeffrey Gundlach

Jeffrey Gundlach, colloqualliy known as the "Bond King" is the founder of the DoubleLine Capital investment firm.

He speaks frequently and this post summarizes his main points by talk.

## Yahoo Finance Interview (May 13, 2021)

When the Fed grows their balance sheet, the S&P 500 index goes up.

The CPI came in at 4.2% YoY.

About a third of last months personal disposible income was given by the government.

Government has a deficit that's 30% of GDP.

These have distorted the valuations of asset classes.

Home prices are up very strongly over the last 12 months.  Some markets are up 30-40%.

Businesses can't fill job openings.

A certain fraction of people are making more money sitting at home, watching Netflix, than going to work.

The stimulus checks are starting to feel like they're not going away.  Gavin Newsom announced $600 this week to people that are earning less than $75k a year.

In NY and California, a lot of people are getting $57k a year, tax free, for not working.

Gudlach bought a used truck with 8,000 miles on it, haha, dude is a billionaire.

Feels to him that the market started worrying about inflation this week.  He thinks that inflation will still go up for the next few months.  It if keeps going up in the fall, then people will really get worried.

The Fed is most content when the inflation rate is higher than all the interest rates, across the yield curve.

He thinks we already have UBI at this point.

Unemployment has been extended and extended and even increased.

People's behavior is already factoring in ongoing government assistance.

Bitcoin and the other cryptos have been objects of speculation.  Playing with funny money.  People feel like they're playing with the houses money.

He was really bullish on Bitcoin in early 2020.

NASDAQ has been underperforming the S&P for quite some time now.  This is a sign that some of the speculative fever is dissapating.

He's been very bullish on commodities, but might be overextended in the short run.

Thinks floating rate corporate debt is good, BKLN.

Thanks to valuation and longer term dollar view, he's bullish European equities.  He's long term bearish on the dollar.

He likes Emerging Market equities longer term.  He thinks they'll do well, but probably not this year.  They're slower rolling out the vaccine in Emerging Markets.

## AKG Fundraiser (April 22, 2021)

Capital gains tax for those making more a million in California will be 57% with president Biden's new proposal.

% of personal income made up by government transfer payments went from 6% in the 60s to ~18% post the Global Financial Crisis to 27% in 2021.

US government is spending 8 trillion a year.  56% of that government spending is debt.

Unfunded liabilities are so huge that the US will not be able to pay them back, so they'll need to be restructured (a nice way to say defaulting).

The US trade balance is at -3.4%.  That means we're importing more than we're exporting.

A lot of the stimulus money that's being paid is going to China.  Americans are using stimulus payments to buy products from China.

The budget deficit is at 19% and that doesn't even count "one off items" that are really recurring expenses (like natural disasters and wars).  The government chooses to mislead the population on how big the bugdet deficit really is.  If you factor in these expenses, the deficit is really 23% of GDP.

Gundlach doesn't agree that the economy was great in 2019 / early 2020 (pre COVID).  That economic growth was based on an increase in the deficit.  More deficits to buy products from other countries is not real economic growth.

We can an explosion in the deficit.  California has many characteristics that are similar to a developing nation.  Lots of debt, terrible infrastructure, massive wealth inequality.

We still have millions of people that want to immigrate to the US.  Part of this is because the US is giving so much away.

Twin deficits: budget deficit & trade deficit.

2011 - 2020: strengthening of the dollar & decreasing commodity prices.

Dollar started going down starting with the pandemic.

It's "virtually certain" that the dollar is going down.

Commodity prices have skyrocketed in the last year.  It's very rare to see a linear upwards move in commodities over a sustained period.

He thinks the Fed wants headline inflation to rise.  Doubleline thinks there is a chance to get the CPI year-over-year (YoY) up to 4% in the next few months (most recent reading was 2.6%).

NASDAQ 100 has relatively outperformed the broad S&P 500 index by 3x.  There has been a huge outperformance of tech.  The US stock market has vastly outperformed the rest of the world.

He believes a lot of the 10 year trends might start reversing and this might start happening:

* NASDAQ underperform S&P 500
* Dollar depreciating
* Commodities start rising
* European stock market outperforms US stock market

He's allocated from American stocks to European stocks at Doubleline for the first time in the history of the firm.

The technology sector is 6% of nominal GDP, 2% of employment, and 38% of the S&P 500 index (November-December 2020 numbers).

The tech sector is causing strains to our society with regards to inequality, data gathering, and political contributions.

Home prices are up 17% YoY.  In some parts of Buffalo, they're up 30% YoY.  It doesn't help the economy much if house prices are rising faster than inflation.

Cash out refinanciang is one of the dumbest things you can do.  It's basically like rebuying your house at a higher price.

People should start saving money before they spend.  This concept is foreign to people that operate in the American economy.

Now is the time to own non-US stocks (based upon valuation & the direction of the dollar).
