# Jeffrey Gundlach

Jeffrey Gundlach, colloqualliy known as the "Bond King" is the founder of the DoubleLine Capital investment firm.

He speaks frequently and this post summarizes his main points by talk.

## CNBC Fast Money Halftime Report (July 15, 2021)

We're at extremely high stock market valuations.

Stocks are still cheap to bonds because the bong yield is so incredibly low.

It's getting hard for the Fed to talk about the inflation situation as transitory.

Seems like the Fed wants the 30 year to be capped at 2%.

All the stimulus / free money should be coming to an end in the next few weeks and Gundlach just doesn't think that'll happen.  He doesn't believe they can go cold turkey.

If stimulus continues at the current level, inflation won't go away, it might actually get worse in fact.

The strongest economy in the world is China.  Stimulus helps China because we buy so many Chinese goods.

Some Fed officials are starting to admit that inflation will hang around longer than they origianlly expected.

The dollar has been reasonably strong.

Ultimately the size of our deficits (trade and budget) suggest that in the intermediate term, the dollar will fall pretty substantially.

In the near term, the dollar seems firm.

Commodities are way up this year, but gold is actually down this year.

Many pension plans have reached their best funding status since prior to the Global Financial Crisis.

CPI at 5.4% and the 10 year Treasury is at 1.3% - that's a -4% real interest rate.

Businesses will have to pay people more to get workers.

Wage inflation is hard to slow down once it starts.

Businesses might need to start compete with governments at the low-end level of wages for workers.  This could lead to wage inflation.

It was only 3 months ago they were predicting a transitory inflation high of 3%.

Inflation is still accelerating.  It's not decelerating yet.  He still thinks the CPI will continue surprising on the upside.  "The trend is your friend".

SPACs and meme stocks are fueled by governement stimulus.  Government stimulus causes spending and speculation.

The corporate bond market is the most overvalued that it's been for the last 20 years.

He's building a museum in Buffalo - the AKG art museum.

Buffalo is a booming city and it's unappreciated.

Bitcoin is a proxy for speculative fervor.  He was buillish at the end of 2020.

He has a feeling you'll be able to buy it below $23,000 again.

He's never been long or short Bitcoin.  It's just not for his risk tolerance.  He'd be too worried to see it down or up 20% in a day.

Companies are having a hard time finding employees.  There is clearly a shortage of workers.

The job openings index came out at a record high.

We'll see if the stimulus continues in September.

Nominal GDP is forecasted to be 10% for the year.

The current budget deficit is 16% which is the highest in the history of the United States.  This understates the deficit cause it omits ~5% of spending that's not included even though it's a recurring expense every year.

If we didn't have deficit spending we would have no GDP growth in the United States.

The Fed's balance sheet has gone from 4 trillion => 8 trillion.

The unfunded liabilities are currently at $148 trillion (~6-7 times GDP).

The strongest economy in the world right now is China.

Consumer expectations for rising prices have grown significantly.

Food prices are up 6% YoY.

Used car prices have doubled over the last year.

[Here](https://youtu.be/1S1ZmBokzJ8?t=1230) is where Gundlach starts talking about the dollar.

Dollar index (DXY) is around 90.

He's neutral on the dollar in the short run, but very negative on the dollar in the long term.

The current account + budget balance is highly correlated with the direction of the dollar.  Right now, the twin deficits are projecting that the dollar index should fall to below 70.  This have meaningful ramifications for investment allocation and portfolio performance.

Home inventory is at record low levels.  There are some areas of the country where there are multiple real estate agents per homes for sale.  Some markets have 10x more real estate agents per home for sale!

The US equity market has outperformed the ROW very significatly since 2008.

Non-US stocks have been performing the same or better than US stocks recently.

He feels weird being positive on European stocks because he was negative on them for the last 12 years, since the founding of DoubleLine.

The NY & SF office occupancy went down by 80% and still hasn't gone back up.

They expect people to start going back to the office after the summer.

Top 5 states losing people:

* New Jersey
* New York
* Illinois
* Connecticut
* California

The anti-business states that have a high cost of living are not surprisingly losing the most people.

Huge downtrend in commodities from 2008 - 2020.  Recent upswing from the low has been significant, but nothing close to reversing the trend.

The US dollar is highly correlated with commodity prices.  When the commodity index goes up, the dollar goes down.

He ultimately thinks gold will go a lot higher as commodities rise.

## Welcome and Fireside Chat (May 12, 2021)

[Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsmjCUwwfA&t=552s&ab_channel=DoubleLineCapitalDoubleLineCapital).

Sam Garza is hosting the chat.  He's been at Doubleline since the beginning.

Bond yields have come down pretty dramatically from the early 80s till now.

Bond yields were really high when he entered the profession.  May 1984, the long bond yield was at 14% and the inflation rate was 4%.  There was a 1000bp real yield on bonds.  Nobody wanted them.  They called bonds "certificates of confiscation" at the time.

Investors didn't think the 4% inflation rate was going to sustain in 1984.  They thought inflation was going to come back for sure.

Back when Gundlach started in this business, people thought that bond yields in the single digits made no sense.

Real bond yield is now negative 250bp.

Fed & Treasury Secretary (Janet Yellen) say the inflation rate is transitory.

He has great respect for Stanley Drukenmiller.

We're in uncharted waters now in the same way we were in uncharted waters 1984.

The long bond bottomed at 1.00%.

The rate of change of society continues to accelerate.

Gundlach is sad that society has devolved to its current level.  We'll need to find a new level place to stand and until then, there will be a lot of instability.

He's confident America will be in a great place several years from now.

He doesn't really know if this inflation is transitory and he doesn't think anyone knows.

In NY State, if you're not working, you can get $57,000 tax free.

56% of Federal spending is borrowed (lent to them from the Federal Reserve).

Median household income is very close to the amount of money the government will give you for not working.

If you want to believe that inflation is transitory, you have to believe that the government's policies are transitory, and it's getting hard to believe that.

If the government stops distributing free money, then the economy would collapse.

The CPI uses "owners equivalent rent", but if they used home prices instead, then the CPI would have been 8%.

He thinks Dogecoin & GameStop are obvious manias.

There is incredible inconsistency in the movement of the main stock market averages recently.  The Dow it up and the Nasdaq is down.  Or the S&P 500 is down and the Nasdaq is flat.

He is super bearish on the US dollar.  "The dollar is doomed with the policies that are currently being enacted".

Trade deficit is expanding and the budget deficit is more than expanding - it's exploding.  Both factors are quite negative for the dollar.

They have a more positive view on European stocks compared to American stocks since Doubleline was started 12 years ago.

The dollar has benefited from being the reserve currency of the world.  It seems clear that China would like a seat at the table of being the world's reserve currency.

China's GDP will eclipse the US GDP in the next several years.

Saving is the national pasttime in China.  Borowing & spending is the national pasttime in the US.

There has been $6 trillion dollars of stimulus in the past year and most of it has been used to buy Chinese goods.

Gundlach has a good emotional memory.  He's "made every mistake you can make in the investment industry, twice".

A good emotional & factual memory.  You want to be able to say "I've seen this movie before".

The US will have to reset their economic system.

The societal institutions that were created in the aftermath of World War 2 are not working anymore.

Wealth inequality is the result of money printing.  We're trying to use money printing to give money to the poor, but that doesn't work because it doesn't increase the productive capacity of the economy.

The good news is that these institutions will change.

We're going to get there, but we need to go through the transformative period.

He thinks commodity prices will go a lot higher, that's part of his negative dollar view.

We've inflated the value of financial assets so much that it's time for a trend change.

Gundlach's favorite investment right now is farmland.  Farmland is essential to human existence.

Farmland has underperformed by a lot and has real value.

Gundlach thinks the stock market is doomed if the Fed starts tapering its balance sheet.

We are in the mirror image of where we were when Gundlach started in this business in 1984.

## Yahoo Finance Interview (May 13, 2021)

When the Fed grows their balance sheet, the S&P 500 index goes up.

The CPI came in at 4.2% YoY.

About a third of last months personal disposible income was given by the government.

Government has a deficit that's 30% of GDP.

These have distorted the valuations of asset classes.

Home prices are up very strongly over the last 12 months.  Some markets are up 30-40%.

Businesses can't fill job openings.

A certain fraction of people are making more money sitting at home, watching Netflix, than going to work.

The stimulus checks are starting to feel like they're not going away.  Gavin Newsom announced $600 this week to people that are earning less than $75k a year.

In NY and California, a lot of people are getting $57k a year, tax free, for not working.

Gudlach bought a used truck with 8,000 miles on it, haha, dude is a billionaire.

Feels to him that the market started worrying about inflation this week.  He thinks that inflation will still go up for the next few months.  It if keeps going up in the fall, then people will really get worried.

The Fed is most content when the inflation rate is higher than all the interest rates, across the yield curve.

He thinks we already have UBI at this point.

Unemployment has been extended and extended and even increased.

People's behavior is already factoring in ongoing government assistance.

Bitcoin and the other cryptos have been objects of speculation.  Playing with funny money.  People feel like they're playing with the house's money (e.g. the money the government direct deposited in their bank account).

He was really bullish on Bitcoin in early 2020.

NASDAQ has been underperforming the S&P for quite some time now.  This is a sign that some of the speculative fever is dissapating.

He's been very bullish on commodities, but might be overextended in the short run.

Thinks floating rate corporate debt is good, BKLN.

Thanks to valuation and longer term dollar view, he's bullish European equities.  He's long term bearish on the dollar.

He likes Emerging Market equities longer term.  He thinks they'll do well, but probably not this year.  Emerging Markets are slower in rolling out the vaccine.

## AKG Fundraiser (April 22, 2021)

[Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy65QvvsXPI&t=555s&ab_channel=DoubleLineCapital).

Capital gains tax for those making more a million in California will be 57% with president Biden's new proposal.

% of personal income made up by government transfer payments went from 6% in the 60s to ~18% post the Global Financial Crisis to 27% in 2021.

US government is spending 8 trillion a year.  56% of that government spending is debt.

Unfunded liabilities are so huge that the US will not be able to pay them back, so they'll need to be restructured (a nice way to say defaulting).

The US trade balance is at -3.4%.  That means we're importing more than we're exporting.

A lot of the stimulus money that's being paid is going to China.  Americans are using stimulus payments to buy products from China.

The budget deficit is at 19% and that doesn't even count "one off items" that are really recurring expenses (like natural disasters and wars).  The government chooses to mislead the population on how big the bugdet deficit really is.  If you factor in these expenses, the deficit is really 23% of GDP.

Gundlach doesn't agree that the economy was great in 2019 / early 2020 (pre COVID).  That economic growth was based on an increase in the deficit.  Increasing the deficit to buy products from other countries is not real economic growth.

California has many characteristics that are similar to a developing nation.  Lots of debt, terrible infrastructure, massive wealth inequality.

We still have millions of people that want to immigrate to the US.  Part of this is because the US is giving so much away.

Twin deficits: budget deficit & trade deficit.

2011 - 2020: strengthening of the dollar & decreasing commodity prices.

Dollar started going down starting with the pandemic.

It's "virtually certain" that the dollar is going down.

Commodity prices have skyrocketed in the last year.  It's very rare to see a linear upwards move in commodities over a sustained period.

He thinks the Fed wants headline inflation to rise.  Doubleline thinks there is a chance to get the CPI year-over-year (YoY) up to 4% in the next few months (most recent reading was 2.6%).

NASDAQ 100 has relatively outperformed the broad S&P 500 index by 3x.  There has been a huge outperformance of tech.  The US stock market has vastly outperformed the rest of the world.

He believes a lot of the 10 year trends might start reversing and this might start happening:

* NASDAQ underperform S&P 500
* Dollar depreciating
* Commodities start rising
* European stock market outperforms US stock market

He's allocated from American stocks to European stocks at Doubleline for the first time in the history of the firm.

The technology sector is 6% of nominal GDP, 2% of employment, and 38% of the S&P 500 index (November-December 2020 numbers).

The tech sector is causing strains to our society with regards to inequality, data gathering, and political contributions.

Home prices are up 17% YoY.  In some parts of Buffalo, they're up 30% YoY.  It doesn't help the economy much if house prices are rising faster than inflation.

Cash out refinanciang is one of the dumbest things you can do.  It's basically like rebuying your house at a higher price.

People should start saving money before they spend.  This concept is foreign to people that operate in the American economy.

Now is the time to own non-US stocks (based upon valuation & the direction of the dollar).
