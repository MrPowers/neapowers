# Inexpensive Country ETFs for Value Investors

The United States stock market has been on a bull run from March 2009 till February 2021 and is now expensive by certain valuation metrics.

Jeremy Grantham [recently published a piece](https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/) arguing that it's highly probable that the US is in a major bubble and investors should consider alternatives.  His article was written in January 2021.

Other global stock markets have not performed well and are near 2009 financial crisis lows.  ETFs make it easy to invest in index funds that offer broad diversification in these contries.

Shifting from highly valued US growth stocks to cheap international ETFs is one way to "sell high and buy low".  The shift can be 2% or 70% - reallocation isn't binary and there are different degrees of changes.

Selling winners and buying losers is a natural part of rebalancing.  In this market, rebalancing involves reallocating from US growth exposure to international value.

The magnitude of the reallocation should depend on the investors current allocation, long term investing goals, and risk tolerance as outlined in your Investment Policy Statement (IPS).  If you don't have a formal IPS, you're sailing without a compass and will find it hard to navigate these choppy financial waters.

US growth, US bonds, and crypto are all arguably in bubble territory.  Reallocating to cheap assets may limit downside in the event of a bear market.

Here are the stock markets that'll be covered in the rest of this blog post:

* United States
* Colombia
* Russia
* Malaysia
* Turkey

## S&P 500 performance

The S&P 500 index bottomed out at 666 in March 2009 and currently sits at 3,935.

It's up around 6x from the bear market lows.

Warren Buffett told investors to [Buy American](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17buffett.html) in October 2008 when the S&P was around 950, which turned out to be great advice.  His advice was early and didn't nail the bottom, but great in the long run - typical value investor.

Optimal investment allocation typically runs against human psychology.  Most investors do not heed the adage "Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful".  Buffett's buy call was in the midst of great market chaos and doubt.

Investors don't have the stomach to buy when there is blood in the streets.  They also can't bear sitting on the sidelines when their neighbors are getting rich.  Retail investors are psychologically pulled towards buying high and selling low.

Not surprisingly, at all time market highs, "The volume of small retail purchases, of less than 10 contracts, of call options on U.S. equities has increased 8-fold compared to 2019, and 2019 was already well above long-run average" [source](https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/).

Lots of retail investors are downloading Robinhood and trading options.  We're in uncharted speculative territory.

## Colombian stocks

Colombia is a South American country of 50 million people with a growing economy.  Take a look at a graph of the Colombian vs. US GDP growth from 2009 to 2019:

The Colombian GDP growth has outpaced US GDP growth almost every year for the last 10 years, but the Colombian stock market has been flat.

The Global X MSCI Colombia ETF (GXG) fund is at February 2009 levels as of February 2021.

The US dollar has strengthened significantly against the Colombian peso over the last 10 years, which has been a drag on GXG returns.

GXG is mainly invested in financial (49%), energy (17%), and utilities (17%), sectors which haven't done well.

The underlying companies that compose the index (e.g. Bancolombia and Ecopetrol) are big, profitable companies that are traded on American stock exchanges.

The fund is paying a solid 2.9% dividend yield.
