## Nouriel Roubini Sees Global Debt Trap Driving Inflation

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suIXG4Iw1sY&ab_channel=BloombergMarketsandFinance).

Roubini predicted the 2008 housing bubble.

Debt levels, both private and public, are much higher than they were before.

Roubini's concern is that we're in a debt trap.

The Fed won't be able to unravel unconventional monetary policy.

In normal times, we don't reduce debts or deficits.  Then a crisis hits and deficits grow even more.  Debt grows in good times and in bad.

We'll wipe out the value of fixed rate debt with higher inflation.

Inflation will wipe out the real debt.

* Governments are pressured to increase spending around the world
* There are constraints on taxing the rich more

Roubini sees inflation and debt crises forthcoming.  Cause interest rates will be rising and indebted companies will suffer.

What he predicts:

* Deglobalization & protectionism
* balkanization of global supply chains
* aging of economies
* restriction of migration from south to north
* decoupling between US and China
* global climate change
* pandemics
* cyber warfare
* rising inequality implies government policy that'll help workersaging of economies
* restriction of migration from south to north
* decoupling between US and China
* global climate change
* pandemics
* cyber warfare
* rising inequality implies government policy that'll help workers.  This puts upward pressure on wages.

He's worried about stagflation.

For the last 30 years, there have been global forces keeping inflation low.  He thinks these forces are reversing.

He expects a huge amount of technological innovation in America.  AI, machine learning, robotics, automation.

Over time, this will increase productivity, but it'll also increase inequality.

He worries that central banks are on a mission creep.  From inflation => growth => financial stability => income inequality => global climate change, etc.

Highly unconventional Fed policy will cause inflation over time.

## A stagflationary debt crisis is on the way (July 28, 2021)

The stagflationary debt crisis is on the way here.

Stagflation is high inflation and low economic growth.

Last time we had stagflation was the 1970s.  Now, debt ratios, both public and private, are much higher.

After the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), we had a debt crisis, but low inflation.  In the 1980s, we had recession to fight inflation, but we didn't have debt problems.  We could have the worst of both worlds now:

* the stagflation of the 1970s
* the debt crisis after the GFC

Roubini lists 9 major, long term, negative supply shocks.

Because of inequality, we have deglobalization.

We will now see Balkanization of global supply chains.

The populations are aging, not only in the US and Europe, but also Korea, China, and Russia.

We're restricting migration from south to north and that was something that kept a lid on wage pressures in advanced economies.

We're going to have a decoupling between the US and China as a result of the cold war becoming colder.

Global climate change is also stagflationary.

Cyber attacks will cost firms hundreds of billions.

There is a backlash against inequality and there will be a lot more pro-worker legislation going forward.

The massive fiscal stimulus went to the lower end labor workers and puts them in a position of strength.  They don't have to accept a low wage job at the moment because they're getting unemployment benefits.

Going forward there will be shifts from capital to labor and from profits to wages.

The Fed is in a debt trap:

* They should be tapering right now to avoid inflation getting out of control

* They can't tighten right now because debt levels are high and tightening would cause a crash in the bond market, crash in the stock market, and huge recession / depression

The Fed will choose inflation rather than tightening and crashing the economy.  The Fed isn't evil, they're just in a damned if you do, damned if you don't type situation.

The Fed will not be able to exit this unconventional monetary policy.
