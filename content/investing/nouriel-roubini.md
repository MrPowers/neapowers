## A stagflationary debt crisis is on the way (July 28, 2021)

The stagflationary debt crisis is on the way here.

Stagflation is high inflation and low economic growth.

Last time we had stagflation was the 1970s.  Now, debt ratios, both public and private, are much higher.

After the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), we had a debt crisis, but low inflation.  In the 1980s, we had recession to fight inflation, but we didn't have debt problems.  We could have the worst of both worlds now:

* the stagflation of the 1970s
* the debt crisis after the GFC

Roubini lists 9 major, long term, negative supply shocks.

Because of inequality, we have deglobalization.

We will now see Balkanization of global supply chains.

The populations are aging, not only in the US and Europe, but also Korea, China, and Russia.

We're restricting migration from south to north and that was something that kept a lid on wage pressures in advanced economies.

We're going to have a decoupling between the US and China as a result of the cold war becoming colder.

Global climate change is also stagflationary.

Cyber attacks will cost firms hundreds of billions.

There is a backlash against inequality and there will be a lot more pro-worker legislation going forward.

The massive fiscal stimulus went to the lower end labor workers and puts them in a position of strength.  They don't have to accept a low wage job at the moment because they're getting unemployment benefits.

Going forward there will be shifts from capital to labor and from profits to wages.

The Fed is in a debt trap:

* They should be tapering right now to avoid inflation getting out of control

* They can't tighten right now because debt levels are high and tightening would cause a crash in the bond market, crash in the stock market, and huge recession / depression

The Fed will choose inflation rather than tightening and crashing the economy.  The Fed isn't evil, they're just in a damned if you do, damned if you don't type situation.

The Fed will not be able to exit this unconventional monetary policy.
