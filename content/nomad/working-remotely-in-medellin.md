# Working Remotely in Medellin

Medellin is a wonderful place to live and work remotely, especially for folks on the East Coast timezone.

Medellin is easily accessible and full of friendly locals.  The city has a violent history, but is now relatively safe, as long as you follow the street smart rules of Latin America.

The city is still wonderful and offers great value, but it's not the same undiscovered paradise it was back from 2008-2015.

Like many amazing cities, it's been a victim of it's own awesomeness.  There are a lot more foreigners living here now.  The city population has grown and financing is now available for cars, so the smog and traffic have grown.  Certain parts of the city are notoriously gridlocked during rush hour.
